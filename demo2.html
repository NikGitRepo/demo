        <p>The Battle of the Saw was the culminating battle of a campaign fought between a 
            Carthaginian army led by Hamilcar Barca and a rebel force led by Spendius in 238 BC
            nian war elephants and cavalry on open ground, the rebels stayed on higher and rougher 
            terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After several months of campaigning,
            Hamilcar trapped the rebels. Pinned agin what is now northern Tunisia. Carthage was 
            fighting a coalition of mutinous soldiers and rebellious African cities in the Mercenary 
            War which had started in 240 BC. Unable to confront the Carthagiainst local mountains known 
            as "the Saw" due to their sawlike shape, with their supply lines blockaded and with their 
            food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses,their prisoners and then their slaves, 
            hoping that their comrades in Tunis would sortie to rescue them.Eventually, the Carthaginians,
            led by their elephants, attacked the starving rebels and they were all massacred.
